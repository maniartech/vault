# Vault TODO Items

Since the vault is baesd on IndexDB database as storage provider, it is possible to make it more powerful
and useful. Here are some TODO items that I am planning to implement in the
future.

- [ ] Support encrypted values to safeguard sensitive data in the vault
- [ ] Support custom database and storages
- [ ] Support custom encryption and decryption
- [ ] Support querying the vault
- [ ] Support multiple update in a single transaction
